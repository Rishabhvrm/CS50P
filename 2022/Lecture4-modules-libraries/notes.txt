modules are nothing but libraries in python

some of the modules that python comes with:
> random
    > eg: random.choice(seq)
    > eg: random.randint(a,b)
    > eg: random.shuffle(list) // it shuffles the argument in place

> statistics
    > eg: statistics.mean(list)

>sys
    > eg: sys.argv // argument vector, list of words typed in prompt, this list would be contained in a variable called 'argv'
    > eg: sys.exit(statement)

you can load the modules using or 'import'(imports everything in a module) or 'from'
eg: import random
eg: from random import choice
